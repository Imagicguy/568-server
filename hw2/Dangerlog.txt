02/22:
	P1.if the proxy failed to create a new socket from accept(),it can not get request from client.

	P2.Is there a situation that client sends request from socket to same server multiple times?Can
	we close the socket after the first request?
	
02/23:	S1.we solved P1 and P2 by while looping accept() and create one socket & one thread for
	each request.
	P3.For request in chunked encoding fishion or content-length header ,how to handle them separately?

02/25:  S3.For situation in P3,we can parse the request with key word like "Content-Length" or "chunked"

	P4.We use a pretty big buffer to store request and response ,but there is a situation can not be
	handle by this method that client/server maybe pause sending request/response for a while and start to
	send request/reponse later.

02/27   S4.We use a while loop to receive the content from client/server.We have a char* pointer always points
	to the first unused position of our buffer and refresh this pointer after each while loop.if there is a
	"\r\n\r\n" detected in buffer,we break the while loop.
